      <p>Below is a selection of my favourite coding projects: in-browser toys and full web apps. Some were made during my coding bootcamp, others after or even before it. Click on any of them to try it out; head to <a href="https://github.com/RobOwenKing" target="_blank" class="link-dec">my GitHub page</a> to find the source code.</p>

        <h2>Movida-19</h2>
        <p>After my bootcamp I wanted to make a full Rails app all by myself, and make something relevant to the unprecedent situation we are all facing. This was the result. Movida-19 allows users to post either requests for or offers of help then shows posts geocoded as being close to their address. There's also a messaging system so people can get in touch with each other.</p>

        <h2>Quedem</h2>
        <p>This was my final project during my full-stack bootcamp. I was lead dev for my team, having pitched the idea for a way to make it easier to arrange meeting up with friends. It was a great chance to work with a variety of APIs and Ruby gems. We also got to experience working collaboratively at a distance as Spain went into lockdown.</p>

        <h2>Conway's Game of Life</h2>
        <p>As a Maths student, most of the people you admire are dead as you're studying work generally from at least a century ago. John Horton Conway was one of the exceptions for me, a living mathematician I knew of and looked up to. He sadly passed away in April this year, so I decided to implement his classic Game of Life in Javascript, with a little added colour. It also acted as a great opportunity to learn the basics of HTML5 canvas.</p>

        <h2>Colour Translator</h2>
        <p>There are two common ways of representing colour for use on the web: <abbr title="Red, Green, Blue">RGB</abbr> and <abbr title="Hue, Saturation, Lightness">HSL</abbr>. I had got my head around the former; I hadn't a clue about the latter. So I made this tool to see how it works and how the two systems relate to each other.</p>

      <div>
        <h2>Roman Numeral Calculator</h2>
        <p>This was the last project I undertook getting back into coding before I decided to do the bootcamp. There are loads of apps to convert to or from Roman numerals, but it surprised me how hard it was to find a calculator to do sums entirely in that system. So I made one.</p>
